  Imports and Setup:

      - `dotenv/config` is used to load environment variables.
      - `express` is used to create the server.

  Middleware Setup:

      - `cors()` enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the server to handle requests from other origins.
      - `express.json()` parses incoming JSON requests to JavaScript objects.
      - `morgan('dev')` logs HTTP requests in a developer-friendly format.
  
  Web Sockets :
      - Sockets are a way to enable real-time, two-way communication between a client (e.g., a browser) and a server.
        They allow data to be exchanged instantly without the need for continuous requests from the client.

      - Sockets are essential for applications where updates need to happen instantly, such as chat applications, 
        live notifications, stock price updates, and online gaming.
